Data Fetching and Caching:

Use SWR for data fetching, caching, and state management.

Implement axios for making API requests to the provided mock server.

UI Components with MUI 5:

Build the user interface using Material UI (MUI 5) components. Ensure the UI is clean and user-friendly.

Include components like tables or lists for displaying books, text fields for forms, buttons, grid or stack for layout.

TypeScript Integration:

Apply TypeScript throughout the application for type-checking and improving code quality.

Responsive Design:

Ensure the app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

Documentation:

Provide a README file with instructions on setting up and running the application.
